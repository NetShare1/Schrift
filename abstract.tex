\chapter{Abstract}

\begin{english} 
    This diploma thesis deals with the planning and development of a multi-wan bonding prototype, called NetShare. As  Windows does not offer a free-of-charge option to use several internet connections simultaneously and to bundle their bandwidths, we decided to develop such a prototype. 
    \\\\
    For the implementation we need a multi-wan bonding capable server, driver and a Windows desktop application to control the driver. For this reason, we have dealt with the following technologies IP Routing Table, Nating, TUN-/ TAP devices, Virtual Private Networks, Winforms, and Windows drivers.
    \\\\
    In the thesis, we explain the technologies used and the approaches followed in the implementation of our multi-wan bonding prototype. Furthermore, we illustrate with the help of examples how the individual functions have been implemented.
